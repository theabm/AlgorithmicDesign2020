A solution to the homework assignment from the DSSC course in Advanced Programming and Algorithic Design (A.A 2020) by Prof. Casagrande.

1. Implement the binary-heap based version of Dijkstra's algorithm.
2. Consider the contraction hierarchies presented during the course. Assume to deal with graphs that can be fully represeted in the memory of your computer. Implement:
    - an algorhtm to ad the shortcuts to a graph
    - a bidirectional version of Dijskstra algorithm that can operate on the graphs decorated by the previous point. 

The repository contains the binary heap implementation in the file named binheap.py.  Furthermore, it also contains the solution to the first part in HW3.ipynb and to the second part in HW3cont.ipynb.
